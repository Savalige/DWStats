A script for converting UABE dumps for Darkwood to a xlsx ID list for UABE

You can use this to make it easier to find what file you are looking for when modding Darkwood assets

You can either compile your own ID list using dumps from UABE files and putting them into a folder called ID_SEARCH or you can use my already compiled xlsx files

I have also added a stat compiler for items where You can either compile your own item stats using dumps from UABE files and putting them into a folder called STATS or you can use my already compiled xlsx files. I recommend that you convert the number to numbers since they will be handeld as text (this is only for the stat compiler, the ID list should handle this by it self).
